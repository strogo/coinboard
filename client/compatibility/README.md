Some JavaScript libraries only work when placed in the
client/compatibility subdirectory. Files in this directory are
executed without being wrapped in a new variable scope. This means
that each top-level var defines a global variable. In addition, these
files are executed before other client-side JavaScript files.


No need to take minimized versions, Meteor does that for us.
